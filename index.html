            <p>I run intensive design engagements for early-stage startups. When you're stuck with messy Figma files, unclear requirements, or a demo deadline looming, I parachute in and get you to polished and usable, fast.</p>
            <p>No long onboarding. No months of discovery. Just focused execution under pressure.</p>
